Introduction
============

:program:`cygenja` is a small `Python2 <https://docs.python.org/2/>`_ library to generate typed source files from
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_ source templates. We use it extensively to generate our `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_
projects. See :ref:`limitations` to see if this tool
is for you.


What :program:`cygenja` can do
------------------------------

From a bunch of templated (source) files, :program:`cygenja` can generate several (source) files. The translation part is given to the powerful `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_ template engine.
:program:`cygenja` is a layer above this template engine and is in charge of dispatching translation rules to the right subdirectories and apply them to the right bunch of files. A file is **only** generated if it is **older** than
the template file used to produce it, i.e. a change in a template file triggers a regeneration of the corresponding files [#force_generation]_.

How :program:`cygenja` works
----------------------------

Within a *root* directory, you provide some translation rules: each rule is attached to a subdirectory and a file pattern. You can define several rules for one subdirectory.
These rules (called `actions` in :program:`cygenja`) are user defined *callbacks*. Once all rules are registered, the :program:`cygenja` engine
is given a directory pattern and a file pattern: only the matching rules are triggered. See :ref:`cygenja_usage` or look at the :ref:`cygenja_examples` for more.

..  _limitations:

Limitations
-----------

Here is a small list of limitations [#footnote_limitations]_. It is of course not exhaustive but it can already give you a hint if this tool is for you or not.

:program:`cygenja` only parses subdirectories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:program:`cygenja` can only parse subdirectories from a root directory. This means
that it **cannot** generate files located at the root directory level (or outside the root directory).

:program:`cygenja` generates files in place
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Files can only be generated in the same subdirectories as their corresponding templates.

Templates and generated files **must** have different extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Templates are identified by specific extensions. The corresponding generated files will be given specific corresponding extensions too. This extension correspondance is defined by the user but both extensions
**must** be different. For instance, `*.cpd` templated files are transformed into `*.pxd` files. Both extensions, `.cpd` and `.pxd` **are** be different.

File patterns: only :program:`fnmatch` patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation rules can only be applied to files corresponding to `fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html>`_ patterns. While this covers most cases, it might be a limitation for some.

We also use the same kind of file patterns to trigger the translation.

Directory patterns: only :program:`glob` patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To select the subdirectory(ies) within which the rules will be applied by :program:`cygenja`'s engine, only  `glob <https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html>`_ patterns can be used.

Contradictory *actions* are not filtered nor monitored
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nothing prevents you from registering conflicting actions. In this case, only the **first** registered action is guaranteed to be triggered.
