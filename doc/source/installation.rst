Installing :program:`cygenja`
=========================================================

Installing :program:`cygenja` is really easy.

Dependencies
==================

The only dependency is the `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ library. 


If you want to generate the documentation, you need `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and the `sphinx_bootstrap_theme <https://ryan-roemer.github.io/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/README.html>`_ (and possibly `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ and 
several sub modules/packages). To generate the documentation, :program:`cygenja` does not need to be installed. 

Installation
=============

Download source files from `Github <https://github.com/PythonOptimizers/cygenja>`_ (or clone the repository) and invoke the traditionnal:

..  code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

in a virtual environment or globally with full admin rights.
